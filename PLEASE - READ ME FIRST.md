# TradeVerse

This project was built for Database Design Competition in BUS-S307 Data Management course at Indiana University Bloomington (Kelley School of Business). 
The database was designed based on the concept of a socially mock trading and investing company called TradeVerse,
which aimed to improve college students' involvement in the finance world.

This project processed the stages of database development from conceptual and logical designs to SQL coding and prototyping.
The SQL coding part consists of creating tables, inserting data, and writing sample queries.

This project offered hands-on experience in developing a database application using Oracle platform.
